# EscapeGame

Produced in UE4, this mini game is about escaping from a locked area by solving puzzles.

You can build the project in UE4 using the config, content and source folders provided. 

Demonstrations of the game running can be found below:

Room 1 (introduction to controls) and room 2 (ball puzzle) - Room 1 is designed to allow the player to get used to the controls and understand that fire will hurt! and how to heal with healing pills. Room 2 requires the player to pick up the ball and put it in the ball run. They also need to destroy blocks to allow the ball to progress. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ylqqe2zxgzc4kb5/FirstTwoRooms.mp4?dl=0

Garden and room 3 (fire room) - The garden contains a maze with spike pits (which killed me at the end of the last video!). The fire room requires the player to use moving platforms to navigate across the fire without getting burnt. https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3wyk6du0k8n92k/MazeAndFire.mp4?dl=0

Room 4 (block puzzle) - In this room the player has to arrange the blocks in the correct place in order to unlock the door. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ub7ib49eukvtlb9/LastRoom.mp4?dl=0
